- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanDemo, a passionate and versatile frontend developer based in Myanmar. With a solid background in JavaScript, React, and React Native, I thrive on building intuitive and engaging user interfaces that bring ideas to life.
- 🚀 Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from e-commerce websites and mobile apps to arcade game platforms and HR management systems. My experience spans across both frontend and full-stack development, allowing me to tackle challenges with a holistic perspective.
- 🌟 I take pride in my ability to lead teams, mentor junior developers, and drive projects to success. Whether it's optimizing performance, integrating APIs, or implementing custom solutions, I'm always up for the challenge and committed to delivering high-quality results.
- 💡 Outside of coding, you'll often find me exploring the latest trends in frontend development, experimenting with new technologies, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and staying curious in an ever-evolving tech landscape.
- 👀 I’m also interested in game developments...
- 💞️ Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to reach out to me.
